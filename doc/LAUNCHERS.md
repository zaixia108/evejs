# Launcher Guide

This is the "what should I click?" page.

If you do not want to guess which batch file matters, use this.

## The Only Two Buttons Most People Need

* `tools\\\\\\\\ClientSETUP\\\\\\\\StartClientSetup.bat`
* `StartServer.bat`

That is enough for normal **local** setup and play.

For **friends over LAN / remote host**, use the quick pair:

* `Server.bat` on the host PC
* `Client.bat` on each friend PC (from `_local\player-connect-bundle\`)

## What Each Launcher Does

|Click this|Use it when|What it does|
|-|-|-|
|`tools\\\\\\\\ClientSETUP\\\\\\\\StartClientSetup.bat`|First-time setup|Walks you through client setup, certificate install, patching, and local-server config|
|`StartServer.bat`|Normal daily use|Creates the local database if needed, then starts the server or starts the server and launches the client for you|
|`Server.bat`|Quick multiplayer host|Configures multiplayer, exports connect bundle, opens firewall, starts server only|
|`Client.bat`|Quick multiplayer join|One-click remote client from the host bundle (or repo root after Server.bat)|
|`StartMultiplayerHost.bat`|You want friends to join (older wizard-style)|Configures bind/advertise hosts, exports the PlayerConnect bundle, optionally opens firewall ports, then starts the server|
|`Play.bat`|You already started the server yourself|Launches only the client|
|`_local\player-connect-bundle\Connect.bat`|Friend joining your host|Same as Client.bat inside the exported bundle|
|`tools\DatabaseCreator\CreateDatabase.bat`|You want to create or rebuild local database files manually|Downloads the public EVE SDE and generates `_local\gameStore`|
|`BuildMarketSeed.bat`|You want the optional standalone market|Builds or refreshes the market database|
|`StartMarketServer.bat`|You use the optional standalone market|Starts the separate market daemon|
|`tools\\\\\\\\ConfigEditor\\\\\\\\OpenServerConfig.bat`|You want to edit local config or player data|Creates the local database if needed, then opens the desktop config and database editor|
|`tools\\\\\\\\NewEdenStoreEditor\\\\\\\\StartStoreEditor.bat`|You want to edit store content|Opens the desktop New Eden Store editor|

## Best Choices By Situation

### I am brand new

Click:

```text
tools\\\\\\\\ClientSETUP\\\\\\\\StartClientSetup.bat
```

Then:

```text
StartServer.bat
```

Choose `2`.

The first server start may take longer because it downloads the SDE and generates `_local\gameStore`.

### I already set everything up before

Click:

```text
StartServer.bat
```

Choose:

* `1` if you only want the server
* `2` if you want the server and client together

### I already have the server running and only want to launch the game

Click:

```text
Play.bat
```

### I want friends to join my server

On the host PC:

```text
Server.bat
```

Then copy `_local\player-connect-bundle\` to each friend. Friends double-click `Client.bat`.

### I want the optional fast market

Click these in order:

1. `BuildMarketSeed.bat`
2. `StartMarketServer.bat`
3. `StartServer.bat`

### I want to edit server settings or data

Click:

```text
tools\\\\\\\\ConfigEditor\\\\\\\\OpenServerConfig.bat
```

The first launch may take longer because it generates `_local\gameStore` if the local database is missing.

### I want to edit the store

Click:

```text
tools\\\\\\\\NewEdenStoreEditor\\\\\\\\StartStoreEditor.bat
```

That tool needs Python 3 installed.

## Launchers Most Players Can Ignore

You usually do not need to touch:

* `PlayDebug.bat`
* `tools\\\\\\\\ClientCodeGrabber\\\\\\\\StartCodeGrabber.bat`

You also usually do not need to run `tools\DatabaseCreator\CreateDatabase.bat` by hand. Use it when you want to rebuild the local database with `/force`.

Those are more useful for debugging or project maintenance than normal play.
