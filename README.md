# EVE.js

EVE.js is a local EVE Online server emulator. This release targets **EVE 24.01 build 3396210**, validated against the client and static-data export from June 16, 2026.

## Localhost by default; multiplayer optional

> **EVE.js defaults to localhost-only.** For everyday single-PC use, keep bind addresses on `127.0.0.1`.

To host a private game for friends on LAN (or over a VPN), use the multiplayer host flow instead of editing Docker by hand:

- Host: double-click `StartMultiplayerHost.bat`
- Friends: run `_local\player-connect-bundle\Connect.bat`

See [doc/MULTIPLAYER.md](doc/MULTIPLAYER.md). This is for **trusted friends**, not a hardened public shard. Prefer a VPN over exposing ports to the whole internet.

## Recommended setup: Docker

Docker is the easiest backend setup. It builds a Linux image containing:

- the Node.js game server;
- the Rust market daemon plus both v1 and v2 market seed engines;
- automatic first-run static game-data initialization;
- persistent game and market SQLite databases.

The Windows EVE client still runs directly on your computer; it does not run inside the Linux container.

### Requirements

- Windows with Docker Desktop in **Linux containers** mode;
- a full copied EVE shared cache for build `3396210` (the copy must include `EVE\tq`, `ResFiles`, and `index_tranquility.txt`);
- free local ports `443`, `5222`, `26000`–`26002`, and `40110`;
- Internet access on the first start for image dependencies and the approximately 80 MB EVE SDE download.

Use a copied EVE installation. Do not patch the same installation you use for normal live play.

### 1. Build the Linux image

Open PowerShell in this project folder and confirm Docker is using Linux containers:

```powershell
docker info --format '{{.OSType}}'
```

It should print `linux`. Build the shared local image:

```powershell
docker compose build init
```

The equivalent image-only build command is:

```powershell
docker build --tag evejs-local .
```

### 2. Choose and build the market once

There is one Rust market daemon and two ways to populate its SQLite database. Docker never chooses or replaces a market during normal startup. List the choices:

```powershell
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools engines
```

For the recommended fast, repeatable synthetic market:

```powershell
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools rebuild v1 --preset jita_new_caldari
```

Alternatively, use the latest EVE Ref Tranquility station-market snapshot:

```powershell
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools rebuild v2 `
  --order-filter market-scope-with-npc `
  --market-solar-system-id 30000142
```

The first rebuild also downloads the approximately 80 MB EVE SDE and generates the static game tables. V2 additionally downloads the current market snapshot.

### 3. Start the backend

```powershell
docker compose up --detach
```

Follow progress with:

```powershell
docker compose logs --follow init market server
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop following logs; the containers keep running. The backend is ready when `docker compose ps --all` shows `market` and `server` as healthy and `init` as exited with code `0`:

```powershell
docker compose ps --all
```

### 4. Prepare the Windows client once

After the Docker server is healthy, run:

```text
tools\ClientSETUP\StartClientSetup.bat
```

Select the copied build `3396210` shared-cache folder. The wizard patches the copied client, points it at `127.0.0.1`, and trusts the same local CA that the container generated. Docker bind-mounts the certificate folders into the project so that certificate identity survives container recreation.

### 5. Play

Keep the Docker backend running, then launch the client on Windows:

```text
Play.bat
```

### Daily Docker use

```powershell
# Start or resume the backend
docker compose up --detach

# Check health
docker compose ps

# Follow server and market logs
docker compose logs --follow server market

# Stop the backend but keep all data
docker compose down
```

After pulling project updates, rebuild without resetting data:

```powershell
docker compose up --build --detach
```

Normal startup preserves both databases. The initializer only creates missing static game data; market creation and replacement happen exclusively through the explicit `market-tools rebuild` commands below because the market database also contains player orders and history.

### Market seed engines and maintenance

V1 and v2 are seed engines, not different market daemons. Both produce `market.sqlite` for the same Rust server.

| Engine | Source | Best use |
|---|---|---|
| `v1` | Deterministic synthetic prices and quantities from local static data | Fast, repeatable local worlds |
| `v2` | Latest EVE Ref Tranquility station-order snapshot | TQ-like station liquidity and NPC stock |

V1 supports `jita_new_caldari`, `jita_only`, `new_caldari_only`, and `full_universe`. List them with:

```powershell
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools presets
```

> **Size warning:** `full_universe` can produce hundreds of millions of rows. It is not recommended for ordinary local use.

V2 supports `all-station`, `npc-only`, `player-only`, `market-scope`, and `market-scope-with-npc`. It imports station orders only; player-structure orders are excluded. Inspect the currently published source snapshot without rebuilding:

```powershell
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools snapshot-info
```

V2 reuses the current matching snapshot from the persistent download cache by default. Add `--fresh-download` to a v2 rebuild command to ignore that cache and download the snapshot again.

#### Rebuild an existing market

> **Destructive operation:** a market rebuild replaces seeded liquidity, player orders, order events, consumed stock, and market history. The tool automatically retains a timestamped backup of the previous valid database, but you should still treat this as maintenance and log players out first.

Stop both runtime services, run exactly one rebuild, then start them again:

```powershell
docker compose stop server market

# Synthetic v1 example
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools rebuild v1 --preset jita_only

# OR snapshot-based v2 example
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools rebuild v2 `
  --order-filter market-scope-with-npc `
  --market-solar-system-id 30000142

docker compose up --detach market server
```

The market daemon and rebuild command use a volume lock. A rebuild refuses to run while the market container still has the database open. Candidates are built and validated separately, the existing database is backed up, and only then is the candidate installed.

#### Inspect, back up, and restore the market

```powershell
# Manifest, row counts, SQLite validation, and backup count
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools status

# Full Rust daemon validation; stop server and market first
docker compose stop server market
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools doctor

# Create a named backup while they remain stopped
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools backup before-experiment

# List retained backups
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools backups

# Restore the newest backup, then restart
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools restore latest
docker compose up --detach market server

# Show every market-tools command
docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools help
```

Backups live under `/var/lib/evejs/market/backups` in the persistent `evejs-data` volume.

Runtime market inspection is also available while the backend is running:

```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:40110/health
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:40110/v1/manifest
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:40110/v1/diagnostics
```

The `/v1/` URL is the HTTP API version; it is unrelated to the v1/v2 seed-engine choice.

### Docker command reference

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Build the image | `docker compose build init` |
| Start everything | `docker compose up --detach` |
| Show all service states | `docker compose ps --all` |
| Follow runtime logs | `docker compose logs --follow server market` |
| Restart Node only | `docker compose restart server` |
| Stop runtime services | `docker compose stop server market` |
| Stop containers but retain data | `docker compose down` |
| Open a shell in Node | `docker compose exec server sh` |

### Changing `evejs.config.local.json`

Edit `evejs.config.local.json` in the project root. It allows `//` and block comments, but otherwise uses JSON syntax, so trailing commas are invalid. Each generated setting documents its purpose, accepted values, and default.

The file is copied into the Linux image. Apply host-side changes by rebuilding and recreating the backend:

```powershell
docker compose up --build --detach
```

`docker compose restart` alone does not copy a changed host config into an existing image. Most settings are loaded at Node startup.

Configuration precedence is:

```text
code defaults < evejs.config.json < evejs.config.local.json < EVEJS_* environment variables
```

Use `evejs.config.local.json` for gameplay, economy, NPC, feature, and logging settings. Compose intentionally overrides container plumbing such as bind hosts, localhost-facing URLs, the market daemon address, and the persistent data path. Changing ports or networking therefore also requires matching changes in `compose.yaml`, health checks, and sometimes client setup. Host publications must remain prefixed with `127.0.0.1:`.

Rust market runtime and seeder tuning are separate from the Node JSON configuration. Routine seed selection belongs in the `market-tools rebuild` arguments; advanced defaults live in `docker/market-server.toml`, `docker/market-seed.toml`, and `docker/market-seed-v2.toml` and require an image rebuild.

### Docker persistence

Both SQLite databases, retained market backups, downloaded snapshots, and generated static data live in the named volume `evejs-data`. Normal `stop`, `down`, image rebuild, and container replacement operations preserve it.

> **Data-loss warning:** `docker compose down --volumes` deletes the entire Docker world state, including accounts, characters, inventory, and market state. Use it only when you intentionally want a completely fresh server.

Docker data is separate from the native `_local\gameStore` and `externalservices\market-server\data\generated` paths. Existing native state is not imported automatically.

### Local ports

| Local address | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `127.0.0.1:26000` | Main game TCP server |
| `127.0.0.1:26001` | Image server |
| `127.0.0.1:26002` | Local HTTP proxy and gateway |
| `127.0.0.1:443` | Local HTTPS assets used by the client |
| `127.0.0.1:5222` | XMPP chat |
| `127.0.0.1:40110` | Rust market health and diagnostics |

The Rust RPC port `40111` stays private inside the Docker network.

## Native Windows setup

Use this path only if you do not want Docker. It requires more host tooling and more separate steps.

### Requirements

- Node.js 24 LTS;
- the full copied EVE build `3396210` shared cache;
- Internet access for npm, the SDE, Rust, and build-tool downloads;
- administrator permission for certificate installation and native build tools.

### First-time setup

From PowerShell in the project root:

```powershell
npm ci
npm --prefix server ci
```

Then run these launchers in order:

1. `tools\ClientSETUP\StartClientSetup.bat`
2. `tools\DatabaseCreator\CreateDatabase.bat`
3. `tools\InstallRustForMarket.bat`
4. `BuildMarketSeed.bat` — choose **Jita + New Caldari**
5. `StartMarketServer.bat` — choose the release-server option
6. `StartServer.bat` — choose **Server + Play**

The Rust installer may install the MSVC Rust toolchain, Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, and a Windows SDK. Native server listeners default to `127.0.0.1`; keep all bind-host settings on loopback.

### Daily native use

1. Run `StartMarketServer.bat` and leave it open.
2. Run `StartServer.bat` and choose **Server + Play**.
3. Use `Play.bat` when the backend is already running.

To rebuild only the native game database:

```text
tools\DatabaseCreator\CreateDatabase.bat /force
```

Market reseeding replaces the market SQLite database, including live player market state. Back it up before deliberately reseeding.

## Troubleshooting

- `docker compose ps` — check container and health status.
- `docker compose logs --tail 200 init market server` — inspect recent startup failures.
- `curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:26002/health` — check the Node HTTP side.
- `curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:40110/health` — check the Rust market.
- If Docker cannot publish port `443`, stop the other local program using it before starting EVE.js.
- If the market database is missing, run `docker compose run --rm --no-deps market-tools status`, then choose an explicit v1 or v2 rebuild command above.
- If a rebuild says the market is in use, run `docker compose stop server market` and retry it.
- If the client rejects local TLS, rerun the client setup wizard while the Docker backend is healthy so it installs the persisted Docker CA.
