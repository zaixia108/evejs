/**
 * Phase 0 / 0.C — ownership-aware repository (state-mediation seam).
 *
 * A thin wrapper over the gameStore API that consults the table ownership map
 * and enforces that a domain only MUTATES (write/remove/ensureTable) tables it
 * owns. This is the seam that, in a later phase, becomes "route the mutation
 * to the owning node" instead of "touch the shared cache" — so introducing it
 * now, and migrating call sites onto it domain-by-domain, is what makes the
 * eventual partitioning mechanical.
 *
 * Scope of enforcement (deliberately conservative for Phase 0):
 *   - WRITES (write/remove/ensureTable): a repository bound to domain D may
 *     mutate a table only if the ownership map assigns that table to D.
 *   - SHARED seams (domain "shared"): a DORMANT capability, not a current
 *     policy. The map classifies NO table as "shared" today —
 *     characters/items/skills/accounts were rerouted to single-writer owners
 *     (tableOwnership.js), so isSharedSeam()/onSharedWrite are unexercised.
 *     Classifying a table "shared" is a deliberate opt-in to multi-writer
 *     access (any domain may mutate it); the wrapper surfaces such writes via
 *     onSharedWrite so a genuine cross-domain seam — the kind Phase 3 must
 *     make an explicit transaction — can be audited if one is reintroduced.
 *   - READS: unrestricted and pass straight through (the open 0.B read-
 *     mediation gap). Cross-domain reads are a separate, later concern;
 *     restricting them now would break everything.
 *
 * Adopted by ~33 domain owner modules (Phase 0 / 0.C) and shipped with a pure
 * policy test (server/tests/tableRepository.test.js). The gameStore dependency
 * is injectable (`options.store`) so the policy is testable without opening the
 * database.
